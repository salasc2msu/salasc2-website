<p style="font: Arial"><li>I love anime! I enjoy watching anime, pretty much since I was born. One of my favorite animes is Dragon Ball. As an artist, I love to draw or just do anything that flexes my creative muscle. Things like customizing cars, drawing with pencil and digitally, anything that allows me to be creative!</li>
